Data
====

The first step in any analysis is to get the data. Useful weather data is available from many sources and the format and structure of the data is different in each case. But in each case we need to be able to do two things:

* Fetch the data from a remote repository to local disc.
* Load the data into memory - as an iris cube for gridded data, or a pandas dataframe for point (observation) data.
