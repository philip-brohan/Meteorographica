Examples
========

These are examples of the use of Meteorographica functions to make plots.

These examples use the tiny quantity of :doc:`weather data distributed with this package <data>` and so need no external data source to run. For real use you'll need to get weather data from `another source <http://brohan.org/IRData>`_.
