Meteorographica: a personal library for weather data
====================================================

This code library extends `SciTools <http://scitools.org.uk/>`_ (`Iris <http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/index.html>`_ and `Cartopy <http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html>`_) in providing tools for handling and plotting meteorological data. It uses Iris data structures and methods for handling the data, and adds to it by providing functions for importing data from several sources. It uses Cartopy for making plots, and adds convenience functions for easily making some particular types of plot.

Note that this is one person's personal library: I have no resources for support or extension beyond what is necessary for my own research. You are wellcome to re-use any part of it (subject to the license, see below), but you would almost certainly be better advised to copy any bits you like and incoporate them into your own codebase than to rely on the stability of this..
